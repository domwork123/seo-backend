## 📊 Analytics Opportunities

Track these metrics:
- Onboarding funnel conversion rate
- Drop-off points by step
- Average completion time
- Most common markets
- Most common issues found
- Visibility scores distribution

Views already created in SQL:
- `onboarding_funnel` - Step-by-step counts
- `onboarding_metrics` - Completion rates
